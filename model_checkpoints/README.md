# Model Checkpoints Directory

This directory is for storing trained model checkpoints for the Kashmiri OCR model.

## Purpose

Model checkpoints are saved here during training to:
- Resume training from a specific point
- Evaluate model performance at different stages
- Deploy the best performing model

Checkpoint files will be created automatically during training.
